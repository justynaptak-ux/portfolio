Behind every thing I do and learn is the\r\n          question \"why?\" To develop the topic a bit, I am a cook by education,\r\n          and my specialty is plant cuisine. The recipes are only an inspiration\r\n          for me, and I try to take care of the rest myself.\r\n          <br /> <br /> I have been learning digital photography for a year now,\r\n          devoting almost every free moment to it. Through photos I try to show\r\n          people the world from my perspective. I love this passion for the\r\n          attention it has brought to my life and the motivation to focus more\r\n          deeply on my surroundings. <br /> <br />\r\n          I discovered UX Design barely over a year ago. I really wanted to\r\n          change something in my life and make my work creative and necessary.\r\n          So when I understood what UX Designer was all about, my intuition\r\n          pushed me in this direction. Going deeper into the next issues during\r\n          the courses gave me great satisfaction and I feel excited about my\r\n          future job. <br /> <br />\r\n          It takes a lot of time for me to travel small and large, which I need\r\n          almost like oxygen. I love my home, but I try to take care of this\r\n          need whenever possible. In every city I visit, I want to feel the\r\n          place it has to offer and learn as much as possible about it, while\r\n          avoiding the most famous tourist facilities. Spending time in the\r\n          nature I have learned to relax on a much deeper level, which in other\r\n          conditions is almost impossible.\r\n          <br /> <br /> Other (and there aren't that many) moments I spend on\r\n          learning new things, my latest discoveries are riding a longboard and\r\n          playing a djembe drum. I try to improve my education in various fields\r\n          of knowledge with the help of popular science books, that allow me to\r\n          better understand how this world works.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          <h3>\r\n            Check out my profile on\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/justyna-ptak-ux/\">\r\n              {\" \"}\r\n              LinkedIn{\" \"}\r\n            </a>\r\n            or my\r\n            <a href={CV} download>\r\n              CV\r\n            </a>\r\n          </h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/JustynaPtakCV-319e1ecdb67e57770bd1a2a65474c197.pdf\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
