Behind every thing I do and learn is the\n          question \"why?\" To develop the topic a bit, I am a cook by education,\n          and my specialty is plant cuisine. The recipes are only an inspiration\n          for me, and I try to take care of the rest myself.\n          <br /> <br /> I have been learning digital photography for a year now,\n          devoting almost every free moment to it. Through photos I try to show\n          people the world from my perspective. I love this passion for the\n          attention it has brought to my life and the motivation to focus more\n          deeply on my surroundings. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of time for me\n          to travel small and large, which I need almost like oxygen. The vision\n          of having to stay in one place for too long is tiring for me, so I\n          care about this need to visit whenever I can. In every city I visit, I\n          want to feel the place it has to offer and learn as much as possible\n          about it, while avoiding the most famous tourist facilities. Spending\n          time in the wild I have learned to relax on a much deeper level, which\n          in other conditions is very difficult.\n          <br /> <br /> Other (and there aren't that many) moments I spend on\n          learning new things, my latest discoveries are riding a longboard and\n          playing a djembe drum. I try to improve my education in various fields\n          of knowledge with the help of popular science books that allow me to\n          better understand how this world works.\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default About\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
